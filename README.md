# speedport-plus-phonecalls
Retrieve phone calls from Cosmote Speedport Plus Router using routerâ€™s API.

Tested in Java 8.

Type router credentials in login.txt file and run the executable Jar from Releases within the same folder.
If no file is provided or the credentials from file are wrong, you are asked to type them in a dialog.

Calls (missed, taken, dialed) are shown in Swing UI tables or in CSV files (only when login.txt has csv=true).
